1. Extract to C:/ so C:/EmulatorOvelay/ exists 
2. Run INSTALL/Install.bat (installs python and creates .bat)
3. Move ROMs to into respective /ROMS/ folder e.g. NFSU2.iso -> ROMS/PS2Roms
4. Launch with Shortcut created under /Install/ folder, move to desktop if needed. OR use launcher.bat

Optional:
Enable Launch from XBOX Controller: You can move Intall/XMB_home.bat to (Win+R) 'shell:common startup' to make the emulator overlay accessible from the XBOX Home button on startup.
